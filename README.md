<b>sorted_list_active_choice</b>: This code is intended for use in Active Choice parameters in the jenkins pipeline. It reads data from the inventory file on disk on the jenkins server, selects the group names and server names. Then sorts the lists and merges them into the resulting list. Convenient for pipelines that require host names or names of groups that unite them as a parameter.
